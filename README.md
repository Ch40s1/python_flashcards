# Python Flashcards

I often struggle to keep track of all the coding I do and often wonder if I am retaining anything. This program allows you to create flashcards and store them in a JSON file, providing a convenient way to review your learning progress later on.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone <url>
    ```

2. Set up a virtual environment and install the required dependencies listed in `requirements.txt`. Although not necessary, it's recommended to maintain consistency with the environment setup.

3. Run the program and start creating your flashcards!

    ```bash
    python3 main.py | python main.py
    ```


## Features

- **Create Flashcards**: Add questions and answers to create your own flashcards.
- **Categorization**: Organize flashcards into three categories: Unix Commands, Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), and Functional Programming (FP).

## Future Enhancements

- **Search Functionality**: Implement search functionality to quickly find specific flashcards.
- **Quiz Mode**: Add a quiz mode to test your knowledge using the stored flashcards.
- **Deck Organization**: Allow users to organize flashcards into decks for better management.
- **Testing and Documentation**: Write comprehensive documentation and unit tests to ensure reliability and usability.
- **Save to JSON**: Flashcards are stored in a JSON file, making it easy to persist your progress and review it later.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Intuitive CLI interface with clear instructions and prompts for better usability.
- **Error Handling**: Robust error handling ensures smooth operation and prevents crashes due to unexpected inputs or file operations.
